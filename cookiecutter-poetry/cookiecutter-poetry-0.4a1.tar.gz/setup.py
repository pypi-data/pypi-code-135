The CI/CD\npipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main,\nor when you create a new release.\n\nTo finalize the set-up for publishing to PyPi or Artifactory, see\n[here](https://fpgmaas.github.io/cookiecutter-poetry/features/publishing/#set-up-for-pypi).\nFor activating the automatic documentation with MkDocs, see\n[here](https://fpgmaas.github.io/cookiecutter-poetry/features/mkdocs/#enabling-the-documentation-on-github).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project is partially based on [Audrey\nFeldroy\\\'s](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy)\\\'s great\n[cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage)\nrepository.\n',
